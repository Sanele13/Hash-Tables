Name	 : Hashtable implementation

Description: This program stores images in the hash table. These images are inserted in the table using a hash function that computes
             the indexes assocciated to these images. It also provides the user with operations to print the table contents, to find a desired
             key from the table and adding keys in the table.

Instructions: 

1. Run the class AssignMentThreeDriverClass.java.

2. Then a promt will appear, if answer to this is yes, the table contents are given out and the program terminates. 
   Else if no is an answer, the user is prompted for the image he would like know if its in the table or not. This has to be with the .jpg extension.

3. Now if the user have an image he would like to look for then should enter the image-name.jpg
   Else if user does not want to search for an image, is then asked if he would like to get total number of collisions.

4. If the answer to the prompt on collisions is yes then this number of collisions is given. Then the program terminates.

5. Rerun the program and answer the prompts that the program requests and be provided with the pertinent result to your option. 

Note: The above instructions could have been put inside a loop construct to avoid the rerunning of the program. But I honestly focused on the minimum operations the assignment wanted.
      And my approach to this assignment in my implementation for hash table incoporated the seperate chaining collision resolution routine.
